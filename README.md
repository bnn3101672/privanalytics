# PrivAnalytics

A lightweight, privacy-first, open-source alternative to Google Analytics. Self-hostable and cookie-free.

## About The Project

PrivAnalytics is an open-source, self-hostable web analytics platform with a core design philosophy of protecting visitor privacy. It's designed for developers, bloggers, and open-source projects who need a lightweight, efficient, and privacy-compliant (GDPR, CCPA) alternative to Google Analytics.

It uses a tracking script of less than 2KB, collects no cookies, and performs no fingerprinting, ensuring visitor data remains anonymous. The backend is written in Go for high performance and low resource usage, while the frontend is built with Svelte for a beautiful, real-time interactive dashboard.

Our goal is to bring web analytics back to its essence: understanding traffic trends, not tracking individual behavior.

## Project Status

This project is under active development and has a stable beta release.

- **Latest Update:** We recently released v0.5.0, which introduced a real-time dashboard and reduced the tracker script size by 30%.
- **Community:** The project has a growing interest with over 500 stars (hypothetical) on GitHub. Several community members are testing the beta and providing valuable feedback.
- **Roadmap:** Our future plans include adding more detailed reports (e.g., UTM tag tracking, geo-location analysis) and developing one-click deployment scripts (Docker Compose & Kubernetes).
